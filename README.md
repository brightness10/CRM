# CRM
My take of a Customers Relations Management system. View the app [live on Heroku](https://i-am-crm.herokuapp.com).

This is a fullstack project made from scratch using the following technologies:
- Database - MongoDB (using Mongoose).
- Backend - Node.js (using Express.js server and Axios for http requests)
- Frontend - React.js (using Material UI)

## Project Characteristics
- This React project is made entirely from Material-ui components.
- Made using functional components and React hooks.
- Implements NPM packages such as Moment.js, Recharts, React-day-picker and more.

## Walkthrough
- On the "Clients" tab you can see all exising clients and edit a client's personal details by clicking on its row.
- On "Actions" tab you can add a new client or carry out several actions on an existing client.
- on the "Analytics" you will see charts reflecting the data between the given dates.
   - By default the dates selected would be one year back from today so if there's not enough data displayed you might want to set the dates back to around 2017 - 2018, that's when most of the data is from.
   - You can change the chart type and the category by which the sales are displayed.
